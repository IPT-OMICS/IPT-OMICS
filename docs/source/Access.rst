Accessing the Cluster
=====================

Request for Access
------------------

Access to the HPC cluster is not granted automatically.

You need to have the following prerequisites:

1. Be a registered member of Institut Pasteur de Tunis.
2. Have an active IT Services computing account.

To request for access, please email:

- Contact IPT IT Support Team 


Please include your  username, department, research group and supervisor's name (if applicable).


From Linux & OS X
-----------------

Once your account is set up, you can SSH to the login nodes using your *ITS username and password*:

First open your'e terminal

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh <username>@<host>

e.g. ``ssh -X ab123@192.168.100.211``, where ``<host>`` is ``192.168.100.211`` (the login node) and the *-X* option is to forward X sessions, see man page for SSH (``man ssh``).




.. Tip::
   
From Windows
------------

.. toctree::

   windows-login
   windows-file-transfer
   windows-mount-research-volumes

Connecting to the cluster using windows
-------------------------------------------
Once you have gained youre login information all you need to do is to install
putty from Putty<https://www.putty.org> 

After installing putty all you need to do is to type host name "IP address" and port "22" Enter your login information and password.Â
