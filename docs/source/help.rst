Getting Help
The primary point of contact for users of the HPC facility at Sussex is ITS Research, a sub-division of IT Services.

Users in the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences are asked to contact the schoolâ€™s internal support team.

Distribution lists (groups)
Very recently the old mailing lists based on the Mailman system has been replaced by Distribution groups

Please contact any of the MPS/ITS admins if you need to be added and/or want to create a new Distribution list
